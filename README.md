* Beginners in the field of music learning, especially guitar learners face a lot of dilemma on where to begin with and many at times they lose a track of their learning which makes learning a complicated task. So to cut this slack off, we come with an easy, yet an efficient interface that would facilitate better learning.
* Python 3 and Tk can be used for building a creative application that visually represents different scales, notes, modes, and keys. Such tools are particularly common for string instruments like the guitar. Here, the users can navigate different scales (major, natural minor, harmonic minor, pentatonic, blues, etc.) and chords (5 chords, major, minor, diminished, augmented, and so on) on a 24- fret chart. The purpose of this project is to create a program with which you can find the position of the notes of a given scale in the guitar. 

## :bookmark: **MODULE DESCRIPTION**
* The project being a GUI based application is made using Tkinter, a Python binding to the GUI toolkit. We started off from scratch and saw how we can use lists, dictionaries to build a tool that can help us play the guitar. We all know Music theory is a complex subject made up of a lot of components. For the purposes of this post, we will be simplifying things here quite a bit.
* Here we will treat the fretboard as a UX Component and treat it as an image.  Based on the design guidelines and the test variations, we introduce potential flaws in direct correlation to the design input. These flawed design mockups are manifested as images. Proper labeling of these images ensure proper organization of test data. Once we have a minimal set of images in our arsenal, we are ready to train our model.
